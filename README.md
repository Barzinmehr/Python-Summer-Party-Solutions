# Python Summer Party Notebooks

This repository holds my finished notebooks from the Interview Master Python Summer Party challenge. It’s provided for recruiters, colleagues and learners who want to see my approach to data-analysis tasks using pandas and numpy.

## Usage

1. Create and activate a Python environment 
2. Install the required packages:
   
   pip install jupyterlab pandas numpy
   
3. Start Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VScode (Jupyter extension) and open any `day-XX.ipynb` file.

#### Some code—especially the parts used to filter dates or similar—was repeated for each question. This was due to the nature of the challenge, where for every question we had to clean the data or apply filters again.
